# Data Ethics & Analytical Foundations

**Tools:** Excel | Statistical Analysis | Time Series Forecasting | Decision Trees | Data Ethics

---

## Overview

This repository contains foundational exercises demonstrating analytical and ethical competencies across multiple scenarios. Unlike the other projects in my portfolio, this represents a skills collection rather than a single cohesive case study.

### Key Components

**1. AML Decision Tree**  
Designed bias-free anti-money laundering alert system using behavioral thresholds instead of demographic profiling. Eliminated 6.8x overrepresentation of specific customer groups while maintaining compliance effectiveness.

**2. Time Series Forecasting**  
Analyzed retail sales (1992-2017) and oil prices (1987-2019) to identify trends, seasonality, and volatility patterns. Applied moving averages to support inventory planning and financial forecasting.

**3. Data Ethics Framework**  
Identified security vulnerabilities (PII exposure, inadequate device policies) and developed privacy protection controls to ensure regulatory compliance.

**4. Bias Identification**  
Demonstrated critical thinking about sampling bias, measurement bias, and confounding variables in data collection and model validation.

## Business Impact

- **Compliance:** Prevented discriminatory model deployment; avoided Fair Lending Act violations
- **Efficiency:** Automated alert logic ensures 100% consistent application; time series enables proactive planning
- **Security:** Framework prevents PII exposure incidents and regulatory penalties

## Context

These exercises provide the analytical and ethical foundation supporting the more comprehensive projects in my portfolio (GameCo, Influenza Staffing, Rockbuster, Instacart). They demonstrate competency in statistical methods, forecasting techniques, and responsible data practices.
